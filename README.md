The ipython notebook in this repository use industry-occupation employment data to calculate identify High Tech industries in 2012 and 2014 following the approach in Hecker (2005). This method uses the relative concentration of STEM employment by industry. This implementation relies on the set of 2000 SOC occupations (concorded to 2010 SOC) identified in Hecker (2005) as "technology oriented". Similar results can be obtained using the BLS 2010 listing of STEM occupations.
